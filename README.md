# Air-quality-measuring-system-with-ESP32
This project is an inside air quality measuring system with esp32 and some environmental sensors such as temperature, co2, pressure, humidity, loudness and particle density.
Each sensor has its own library, containing necessary functions for data measurement. These functions are implemented in main. It is an IoT project, being able to send data to a broker webpage 
using MQTT protocols.
